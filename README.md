## Notes
TypeScript is a way of writing JavaScript without the ambiguity, therefore reducing runtime errors. TypeScript is all about *TypeSafety*, which is not present in normal JS. Static Checking is the flagship feature of TypeScript, which means it will give you the error before runtime. <br>
So using typesafety is quite simple. let name: *type* = value; This simple syntax will make sure that the value is of the type you have mentioned. <br>
